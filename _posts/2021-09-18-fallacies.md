title: Fallacies and How to Spot Them
---

In this day and age, fallacies are commonplace. How do you know not to make fallacies when making an argument? You learn to be aware of them, and avoid making them (if you have good faith). What are some common fallacies that people tend to make?

# TL; DR

* An overview of common fallacies, with examples and recommendation on how to avoid making them

# Motivation

Recently, I had an impulse to learn about Logic, mostly because I have never had a class in it specifically (although I took a class about the philosophy of science back in undergraduate), but also because I wanted to understand the symbols in Mathematics (in papers, as I've been reading lots of ML papers and phew, sometimes deciphering the symbols takes half the time of reading the actual paper), but mostly, because I wanted to learn something new. I started with a series of [formal symbolic logic videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFAQACIvhCecgfY66rprv8Q) made by a professor who is quite passionate about teaching Philosophy. What do you know? 8 hours later, I am down a rabbit hole of philosophy videos about how to make valid arguments and how to avoid fallacies. It is fair to say that I learned so much more than just symbols, such as: what is considered a valid argument (formally), the logic behind hypothesis testing, various rules of implications, etc. I would go so far as to say that if students were taught about Logic in high school, people would be less susceptible to common tactics to, say, persuade them into buying a product, misinform them, mislead them, etc.

Anyway, one of the videos I watched was about [22 common (informal) fallacies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUO2asxV-J0). I want to systematically summarize them, give examples, and extract their common form. Note: quite frankly, I am not an expert on this matter, so take this post as a grain of salt. There are nuances and caveats to all of these fallacies. It is more of an exercise in organizing what I learned and what I find fascinating, in a simplified form. 

# Methodology

An argument has the form: "premise(s); therefore, conclusion." A fallacy is an invalid or faulty argument. A fallacy doesn't mean that the conclusion is wrong, but only that the conclusion cannot be supported by the premises. For each fallacy, I present:

* Category - out of 5 categories
    - Irrelevant premise: inference is bad because premises don't support the conclusion
    - Weak or insufficient premise: premises don't strongly support the conclusion, or support it in a trivial way
    - Ambiguous or unclear language: the word or phrase has different meaning in the premises and conclusion
    - False premise: factual error in the premises, technically not a fallacy
    - Invalid reasoning: applicable to formal fallacies
* Common form
* Examples - same conclusion, if possible (mostly to show that fallacies are independent of "sides")
* Recommendation on how to avoid

# Fallacies

## Appeal to Nature Fallacy

* Category: irrelevant premise
* Common form: "Nature is good. A is nature. Therefore, A is good."
* Examples
    - "Being gay is immoral because it's unnatural."
    - "Being gay is good because many animal species engage in homosexuality."
* Recommendation: list things that are natural and good (e.g., water), natural and bad (e.g., wildfire), unnatural and good (e.g., a plane), unnatural and bad (e.g., reality TV)

It is *inconsistent* to argue natural simply implies goodness and unnatural implies badness. The nuance is the vagueness of what is considered natural (without a definition).

## Black and White Thinking, False Dilemma, or False Dichotomy

* Category: false premise
* Common form: "Person X is either A or B. X is not A. Therefore, X is B."
* Examples
    - "If you believe in God, you cannot believe in evolution."
    - "If you believe in evolution, you cannot believe in God."
* Recommendation: imagine positions outside of the polarities, don't rely on emotions only, which tends to see in only black and white

The premise limits all alternatives into 2 options. Of course, sometimes there are only 2 options (e.g., existence), but that premise isn't true most of the time.

## Ad Hominem

* Category: irrelevant premise
* Common form: "Person X have property A. A is bad. Therefore, X is wrong."
* Examples
    - ""
    - ""
* Recommendation: 

Hypocrisy has nothing to do with the logic and content of their argument. Furthermore, an insult is not fallacious by itself, unless it is used to justify the conclusion. Not all ad hominem arguments are fallacious, when the person's [trustworthiness, competence, or sincerity](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/84725205.pdf) is directly affected by the property (e.g., a pathological liar as a trial witness).

* Recommendation:



## Affirming a Disjunct

* Common form: "Either A or B is true. A is true. Therefore, B is not true."
* Examples:
    - ""
    - ""
* Recommendation: 

Part of the issue is that the definition of *or* is implied to be exclusive in natural language, but is inclusive in formal logic, which is made more clear when A and B are not polarities (e.g., "A puppy is either is smart or cute. He is smart. Therefore, he is not cute.")
