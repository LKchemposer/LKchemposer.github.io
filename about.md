Hi you, welcome to **Of Life and Data**, another blog from a data scientist. I want this blog to reflect my personal growth over the years in how I see the world in relation to data and technologies of data, so (hopefully) you'll get to see a few different types of post here: some personal projects, some thoughts about ethics, some concerns about the world, etc. I hope you enjoy your stay!

About me, I am Khoa ([pronounced Kwa](https://youtu.be/HeeWD7n9rBs?t=8)). I am a data scientist (mostly), and I want to use data to improve people's lives. Previously, I worked in a startup in NYC where I worked in the Technology Strategy team. Recently though, I found out that to ensure that the data is able to improve people's lives, you not only have to know how to use the data in a way that is beneficial to all people, but you also have to make sure that other people don't use data to harm others. And so, I wanted to be more than just a data scientist; I want to be one who is aware of the harms of data (and AI), and actively work to resolve them. So, I am also training to be a data or AI ethicist.
